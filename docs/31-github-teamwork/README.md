# GitHub Teamwork

The whole idea of ​​GitHub is to be able to develop software together.

## Issues

An Issue is a ticket or tracking tool for teams to communicate about an idea, work and/or bugs.

**Issue etiquette**
* One issue created per issue in the project
* Titles are descriptive and straight to the point
* Provide evidence like screenshots, video's and errorcodes
* Identify steps to recreate the problem

### Tasklists

To provide a tracking tool for the initiator of the issue one can create a tasklist for the issue.

Simply edit the issue and create the tasklist in markdown.

```markdown
* [] Fix bug in code
* [] Test code
* [] Push code
```

Which results in:

### Assignees

It can become difficult in big projects to remember who is responsible for which issue and which issues you are responsible for. 
Assignees allow you to assign team members to an issue. This helps them track the progress on the issue and helps everyone remember their tasks within the project.
